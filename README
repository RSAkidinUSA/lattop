Author: Ryan Burrow
written for Virginia Tech ECE4984 - Linux Kernel Programming
This kernel module tracks the latencies of all running tasks and their various stack traces. 
It reports to /proc/lattop a list of the top 1000 processes and their highest latency stack trace.
This kernel module was build from the Linus Torvalds v4.12 Kernel.

To build and use this code:
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/RSAkidinUSA/lattop.git
git clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git
cd linux
git checkout tags/v4.12
make
# You will need to install this version of the kernel or have a vm of it to use the module
cd ~/lattop
make
sudo insmod lattop.ko
